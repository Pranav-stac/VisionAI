# Live API - Web Console

This repository contains a react-based starter app for using the [Live API](<[https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api](https://ai.google.dev/api/multimodal-live)>) over a websocket. It provides modules for streaming audio playback, recording user media such as from a microphone, webcam or screen capture as well as a unified log view to aid in development of your application.

[![Live API Demo](readme/thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_q7JY1XxFE)

Watch the demo of the Live API [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_q7JY1XxFE).

## Usage

To get started, [create a free Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and add it to the `.env` file. Then:

```
$ npm install && npm start
```

We have provided several example applications on other branches of this repository:

- [demos/GenExplainer](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genexplainer)
- [demos/GenWeather](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genweather)
- [demos/GenList](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genlist)

## Example

Below is an example of an entire application that will use Google Search grounding and then render graphs using [vega-embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed):

```typescript
import { type FunctionDeclaration, SchemaType } from "@google/generative-ai";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState, memo } from "react";
import vegaEmbed from "vega-embed";
import { useLiveAPIContext } from "../../contexts/LiveAPIContext";

export const declaration: FunctionDeclaration = {
  name: "render_altair",
  description: "Displays an altair graph in json format.",
  parameters: {
    type: SchemaType.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      json_graph: {
        type: SchemaType.STRING,
        description:
          "JSON STRING representation of the graph to render. Must be a string, not a json object",
      },
    },
    required: ["json_graph"],
  },
};

export function Altair() {
  const [jsonString, setJSONString] = useState<string>("");
  const { client, setConfig } = useLiveAPIContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    setConfig({
      model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
      systemInstruction: {
        parts: [
          {
            text: 'You are my helpful assistant. Any time I ask you for a graph call the "render_altair" function I have provided you. Dont ask for additional information just make your best judgement.',
          },
        ],
      },
      tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }, { functionDeclarations: [declaration] }],
    });
  }, [setConfig]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const onToolCall = (toolCall: ToolCall) => {
      console.log(`got toolcall`, toolCall);
      const fc = toolCall.functionCalls.find(
        (fc) => fc.name === declaration.name
      );
      if (fc) {
        const str = (fc.args as any).json_graph;
        setJSONString(str);
      }
    };
    client.on("toolcall", onToolCall);
    return () => {
      client.off("toolcall", onToolCall);
    };
  }, [client]);

  const embedRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (embedRef.current && jsonString) {
      vegaEmbed(embedRef.current, JSON.parse(jsonString));
    }
  }, [embedRef, jsonString]);
  return <div className="vega-embed" ref={embedRef} />;
}
```

## development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project consists of:

- an Event-emitting websocket-client to ease communication between the websocket and the front-end
- communication layer for processing audio in and out
- a boilerplate view for starting to build your apps and view logs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# KnowWiz Vision Voice

A multimodal live API web console that serves as the eyes of a blind person, providing audio descriptions of what it sees through the camera.

## Features

- Voice interaction with camera vision capabilities
- Text input for typed queries
- Data visualization using Altair when requested
- Uses back camera by default for better view of surroundings
- Optimized for mobile devices

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Deployment on Render

This project includes configuration for easy deployment to [Render](https://render.com/):

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository
2. In Render, create a new Web Service
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository
5. Select "Docker" as the runtime
6. Add the environment variable:
   - Key: `REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Gemini API key
7. Click "Create Web Service"

Alternatively, you can use the `render.yaml` file for Blueprint deployment:

1. Fork this repository
2. Update the `repo` URL in `render.yaml` to your forked repository
3. In Render, go to Blueprints
4. Select "New Blueprint Instance"
5. Connect your repository
6. Provide your environment variables when prompted
7. Deploy

## Docker

You can also build and run using Docker directly:

# Build the image
docker build -t knowwiz-vision-voice .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:80 knowwiz-vision-voice
```
